This Code is a part of the DSA assignment where the linear search algorithm is modified and then the solution is explained and analyzed with its Big O notation along with simulation sizes ranging from 10K to 100K. 
Lab Linear Search pdf contains the requirement and the deliverable required 
Another pdf contains the details explanation of the solution.
